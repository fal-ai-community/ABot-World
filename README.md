> **TL;DR:** ABot-World turns a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 desktop GPU into a real-time interactive world simulator, enabling infinite action-conditioned world rollout at 720P, 16 FPS, 1.2s latency, and 19GB GPU memory.

## 🚀 Key Highlights

* 🎮 **Action-Driven World Control:** Responds to user actions in real time, enabling continuous exploration instead of passive video playback.
* ⚡ **Real-Time Desktop Inference:** Runs at 720p and 16 FPS on a single NVIDIA RTX 5090 desktop GPU, with 1.2s latency and 19GB GPU memory.
* ♾️ **Infinite World Rollout:** Supports open-ended interactive world generation beyond fixed video-length limits.
* 🧠 **Open-Ended World Imagination:** Expands the world with new scenes and dynamics during rollout, avoiding scene lock-in, without prompt switching, by our *LongForcing* training.

## 📢 News
- 2026-07-09: We release the causal student model `ABot-World-0-5B-LF`, inference code, our local gradio demo and online playground [ABot World Studio](https://abot-world.amap.com).

## 🛠️ Setup

> This installation was tested on: Ubuntu 22.04, CUDA 13.3, NVIDIA RTX 5090.

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/amap-cvlab/ABot-World.git
cd ABot-World
```

2. Install dependencies using conda:

```bash
conda create -n aworld python=3.12 -y
conda activate aworld
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

3. Download checkpoints:

Download models using HuggingFace:

```bash
pip install -U "huggingface_hub"
hf download acvlab/ABot-World-0-5B-LF --local-dir ./checkpoints/ABot-World-0-5B-LF
```

Download models using ModelScope:

```bash
pip install -U "modelscope"
modelscope download "amap_cvlab/ABot-World-0-5B-LF" --local_dir ./checkpoints/ABot-World-0-5B-LF
```

After downloading, the project should have the following checkpoint structure:

```text
checkpoints/
└── ABot-World-0-5B-LF/
    ├── Wan2.2_VAE.pth
    ├── taew2_2.pth
    ├── models_t5_umt5-xxl-enc-bf16.pth
    ├── diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors
    └── google/umt5-xxl/
```

The checkpoint paths are configured in `configs/long_forcing_dmd.yaml` and
`configs/default_config.yaml`. The distilled generator weights are already
merged into `ABot-World-0-5B-LF/diffusion_pytorch_model.safetensors`.

## 🤗 Gradio Demo

```bash
bash web_client/run.sh
```

Select a GPU with:

```bash
CUDA_ID=0 bash web_client/run.sh
```
